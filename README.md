## Project title
This android app can help users know the weather forecast of a city. Its called **Clouds** written in **Java**

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to try an implement an app using Android Architecture Components. This is a simple app with a clean architecture MVVM where each part of the app is modular.
In this app I also try to implement Dagger 2 and retrofit. 

## Screenshots
There are three main screens of the app
